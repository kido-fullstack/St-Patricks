                    <p class="head-para mb-4">We couldn’t deliver this service to you without our fantastic long-serving team of staff who are warm and welcoming and make each day for your child one to remember. The staff are dedicated to helping children enjoy and achieve, and every child is given an equal chance to accomplish goals and fulfil tasks and activities.<br><br>
                        All children are observed to enable staff to identify every child’s individual needs. Through well-planned activities based on each child’s personal interests and development needs, we are able to maximise learning opportunities giving enjoyment and challenge to help every child fulfil their potential.<br>
                        <br>We are proud of our happy, professional team of nursery practitioners, all of whom have been chosen for their ability and commitment to care for and nurture young children.<br><br>All staff are trained to the highest national standards (NVQ level 4,3 and 2, NNEB, Foundation Degree, EYPS, QTS and Montessori Diploma) or are in the process of achieving such qualifications.
                        Nursery practitioners attend regular first aid, child protection and food hygiene courses. Everyone is encouraged to extend, improve and update their training qualifications and keep up to date with developments and good practice in the Early Years Foundations Stage framework.<br>
                        <br>Our child to adult ratios meet the requirements of Ofsted and we ensure our staff have time to provide the attention each child needs.<br>Ratios:<br>Children under 2 years old: 1 adult to 3 children<br>Children aged 2–3 years old: 1 adult to 4 children<br>Children aged 3-5 years old: 1 adult to 8 children<br>
                        <br>Our staffing structure is designed to manage the nursery effectively and to use our individual strengths to the best advantage. The Nursery Manager and the Deputy Manager are responsible for the day-to-day management of the nursery and they in turn are assisted by the room leaders and Montessori teachers (based in Victoria School House) in planning and teaching the curriculum to children.  We have a permanent team of float staff that work within the nursery, providing extra support and cover for holidays and sickness when needed.</p>

                                All children at St. Patrick’s are encouraged to learn through play. We provide a variety of activities for the children to enjoy and support them in their development. They can be creative and imaginative in their activities and they can learn about the environment, time and different cultures to develop an understanding of the world about them.
                                Our Curriculum covers all the key areas of the Early Years Foundation Stage and is designed to meet the needs of the individual child.Cookery, French, Music and Drama are just some of the extracurricular activities the children can participate in, should they wish.
                                All the children will have an opportunity to take part in a range of planned activities which reflect the appropriate curriculum as well as including all aspects of children’s learning. There will be a chance for the children to lead their own play and this is supported by the trained staff, child-friendly storage and accessible equipment.There is a comfortable rest area in each room which allows your child to have a quiet time to sleep or relax. All sleep and rest times are fully monitored by a member of the team.
                                Your child will play outdoors at least twice a day. Children love playing in all weathers and whether it’s puddle-jumping or enjoying the sunshine, your child will have regular opportunities to enjoy the fresh air and a range of activities with their friends.</p>

We understand that each and every child needs a happy, healthy environment for learning and playing and our day nursery is dedicated to helping parents provide just that. Children at St. Patrick’s benefit immensely from the rich, stimulating environment and the wealth of learning opportunities that are available to them.

                                <b>The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS)</b><br>The first five years of a child’s life is a period of rapid physical and intellectual growth. Recognising the vital importance and formative nature of learning, constant effort is made to ensure that every experience offered to the child is of the highest possible quality. The EYFS framework is broad and balanced and provides progression to the wholeness and all round development of the child which is kept at the forefront of all curriculum planning. Children within the Foundation Stage experience seven areas of learning and development; three are referred to as The Prime Areas and the other four are The Specific Areas. The three prime areas are crucial for igniting children’s curiosity and enthusiasm for learning, and building their capacity to learn, form relationships and thrive.<br></p>
                                <p>The three prime areas are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Communication and language</li>

                                <p>The specific areas are:

                                <p><b>Montessori Method</b><br>
                                The Montessori Method is a method of educating children, based on the research and developments of Italian educator Maria Montessori (1870 – 1952). She has dedicated to studying child development and spent a greater part of her life writing, lecturing and teaching about these practices.
                                The Montessori Method believes that a teacher’s role is to aid and support the child’s exploration and creativity, while the child learns from their environment and other children; at their own pace. This method has shown to help foster independence, confidence, a sense of pride in their achievements and positive self-esteem from an early age.
                                <br>Areas in Montessori
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Practical Life/Everyday Life Activities<br>Practical life lessons involve children carrying out exercises such as polishing, transferring, pouring and threading. Through these simple tasks children learn to concentrate, self-motivate, be confident and become independent.</li>
                                    <li>Sensorial<br>Sensorial lessons take the children through tasks involving textures, smells, weight, sounds, comparisons and sequencing. These tasks help children develop awareness, sensitivity and observation and prepare them for the theories of Mathematics.</li>
                                    <li>Mathematics<br>Practical life and sensorial methods introduce the basics of mathematics into the child’s learning. Therefore, here they learn to count, combine, share, compare and really learn to understand mathematical concepts.</li>
                                    <li>Language and Literacy<br>These lessons introduce phonetic sounds of the alphabet to lead the child towards writing, reading, developing their vocabulary and self-expression.</li>
                                    <li>Cultural<br>Books and role play are used for children to learn new and different cultures. We also educate the child on history, geography, biology, science, cookery and animal care; along with the celebrations of global festivals all of which help the child understand and appreciate all diversities.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br></p>
                                <p><b>Progress check at two</b><br>The nursery supplies parents with a short written summary of their child’s development in the three prime areas of learning and development when the child is aged between 24-36 months. This progress check enables early identification of development needs so that additional support can be put in place, if necessary.
                                <br><b>Observation and Assessment</b><br>Observation, assessment and record keeping are important parts of the educational process which begins as the child starts nursery. Observations are made by all adults, who are involved with the child, including: parents/carers, nursery staff, students and other professionals. At the nursery an initial assessment is based on information from the home setting shared by parents and carers with staff, in addition to information from other settings and agencies.</p>

                            <p><b>Settling in</b><br><br>
                                Once you have accepted our offer of a place at St. Patrick’s you will be given a start date from whence you will start your monthly fee payments.<br>
                                Prior to that start date we will book in a fortnight of visiting times for you and your child to get used to the ambience and set-up of the room in which they will be starting.<br>
                                <br>On the first day one parent/carer (or both) and your child will come mid-morning and stay together in the room for approximately an hour. This gives your child a taster of the activities, the toys, the people and the atmosphere with the security of being close to their parent. Parents get the chance to chat to the staff, giving them an insight into your child’s likes and dislikes, habits, routines and little foibles.<br>
                                <br> From the second day onwards you both come for a little longer each day and after the third day you would probably leave them for about half an hour (…. and go and have a little worried walk around the block!) During the first few days we ask you to bring your child’s milk/drink and food if they would normally eat or drink during the period you are at the nursery. Gradually, over the fortnight, you come for longer and leave them for a longer amount of time, so that, by the end of the fortnight, they stay for half a day including lunchtime. We do not charge during this visiting period.<br><br>When it’s time for your child to move from one room to another, there is a gradual visiting regime over four weeks.   They will start with a brief visit with their Key Worker for an hour or so.  This builds up to your toddler being dropped off by you in their current room, spending most of the day in their new room then being picked up by you from their new room at the end of the day.<br>
                                <br>When moving into Victoria School House, a transition teacher is assigned to visiting children. His/ her role is to introduce the children to the Montessori equipment and induct them into the ways and routines of the room.</p>

                             Morning and afternoon snacks, at around 10.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m., may consist of fresh fruit and drinks with breadsticks, crackers or rice cakes.<br><br>A four-week-rotated lunch menu, at midday, is often a meat, fish or vegetarian-based stew, casserole or bake with staples such as pasta, rice or potatoes accompanied by fresh vegetables or salad. Desserts are homemade favourites such as apple crumble or carrot cake, fresh fruit salad or yoghurt.<br><br>Babies (under 1 year old) will have a hot pureed afternoon tea, served at 4.00 p.m., whereas older children’s tea may consist of sandwiches, filled pitta bread, crudités and dips, cheese scones, homemade biscuits with fresh or dried fruit and a drink. All meals do not knowingly contain GM foods. Vegetarian and special medical and religious diets can be catered for.Water is available to all children at all times.<br><br>We closely follow a baby’s home routine when they start at the nursery. When they are put to bed in their own nursery cot we put them to bed with the same ritual as at home, with their favourite soft toy or dummy, swaddled or stroked, to ensure your baby falls asleep calmly and stress-free.<br>
                             In the Jubilee and Piccadilly room the children usually have an after-lunch sleep together on mattresses in their room. On waking, they can return to toys and activities when they wish.<br>Some of the younger Victoria School House children may also have a quiet post-lunch nap in their room.</p>

                            <p>Inclusion and Special Educational Needs<br>St. Patricks Nursery provides excellent provision for children with disabilities and/or complex medical conditions. These children are valued members of our community and fully participate in all aspects of nursery life. To facilitate the inclusion of these children, the nursery liaises with the local authority as designated special educational needs co-ordinator. Special Educational Needs co-ordinators are assigned to individual children and cater for their primary care needs, to provide learning support and curriculum access to meet their individual needs. Children with complex medical needs will have a special health care plan in place.<br><br>
                            The nursery aims to provide equality of access to the curriculum for all children. We have strategies in place to identify, assess and review the education of children with special educational needs. Some pupils have barriers to learning, which require intervention by the nursery, such as an Individual Education Plan or additional support. Some children may need access to specialist support.<br><br>English as an Additional Language
                            We provide children with English as an additional language with experiences that allows them to develop and enhance their English Language, while continuing to build upon and celebrate their own home language and culture, in a safe environment.</p>
