                        Please note that our policy will be updated in due course. We are awaiting further Government guidance following the announcement of the nationwide third lockdown.<br><br>
                        St. Patrick’s Montessori Nursery School opened its doors on Wednesday 3rd June 2020 following temporary closure due to the Coronavirus pandemic in England.<br><br>
                        If your child is due to attend the nursery, we ask that they should not attend if they have symptoms of Coronavirus or if they have been asked to self-isolate for any reason. Please notify the nursery if your child or a household member is displaying any symptoms of Coronavirus or has tested positive for COVID-19. Do not enter the nursery until after your period of self-isolation as advised by the Government is over.<br><br>
                        Keeping our children and staff safe is our top priority. We want to ensure the safe running of the nursery by minimising the risk of the spread of Coronavirus. We have policies in place for Infection Control, Sickness and Illness and the Coronavirus Pandemic. We will always seek to follow the latest Government guidance and will seek additional support and advice from Public Health England if necessary.<br><br>
                        As guided by the Government, we have a set of actions called a System of Controls as follows:</p>
                        <p>Prevention:<br>

                        <br></p>
                        <p>FAQ<br>
                        <b>What if my child or a member of my household has symptoms of Coronavirus?</b><br>Children should not attend nursery if they have symptoms or if they have been told to self-isolate for any reason. Please follow the Government’s Stay at Home Guidance for Households with Possible or Confirmed Coronavirus Infection. Parents or carers with symptoms of Coronavirus should not drop off or pick up their child. We encourage all symptomatic children to be tested for Coronavirus and ask parents to inform us of the results.<br><br>
                        <b>What if my child becomes unwell with Coronavirus symptoms while at nursery?</b><br>If anyone becomes unwell with a new, continuous cough or a high temperature in the nursery, they will be sent home. While your child is awaiting collection, they will be moved, to an area which is at least 2 metres away from other people and will have adult supervision. PPE will be provided for staff caring for your child while they await collection if a distance of 2 metres cannot be maintained. Do not be alarmed by this, this will help to reduce the spread of infection to staff and other children. All staff and children will be encouraged to be tested for Coronavirus if they show symptoms. After being sent home, children and their household will be asked to self-isolate until they have the results of their Coronavirus test.<br><br>
                        <b>My child has symptoms but has been tested for Coronavirus and is negative?</b><br>If your child is well enough to come into nursery then we will allow them to return. In line with our Medication Policy; we will not admit a child who has had infantile suspension in the morning prior to attending nursery.<br><br>
                        <b>My child has been tested positive for Coronavirus?</b><br>We will ask you to follow Government advice and for your child to self-isolate. The other children and staff in your child’s Bubble will be sent home and advised to self-isolate as per the latest Government guidance. The other household members of the child or staff member in that Bubble do not need to self-isolate unless the child or staff member that they live with subsequently develops symptoms.<br><br>
                        <b>I am still worried about the Coronavirus and I want to keep my child at home, is this possible?</b><br>The Government has advised children to attend so that they can gain the educational and wellbeing benefits. However, we want you to do what you feel is most comfortable in this situation. If you want to keep your child at home then please inform us.<br><br>
                        <b>How will you promote good hand hygiene?</b><br>We will ensure that all adults and children frequently wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds and dry thoroughly. Everyone will clean their hands on arrival at the setting, before and after eating, when returning from the garden, after cleaning and after sneezing or coughing. Children will be assisted with washing their hands when they are not able to do so independently, and we will encourage good hand hygiene through songs and games.<br><br>
                        <b>What if my child does not know how to cough/ sneeze into a tissue?</b><br>We will continue to advise children to use a tissue or elbow to cough or sneeze and use bins for tissue waste. Staff will act as positive role models in order to model this behaviour and to reduce risk of transmission. Games, activities and songs will be used to help promote this.<br><br>
                        <b>Will there be changes to play equipment at the nursery?</b><br>Resources and materials used in the nursery have been assessed for their suitability. Unnecessary items have been removed from access. This includes soft furnishings, soft toys and toys that are hard to clean (such as those with intricate parts). Play equipment is cleaned between groups using it and frequently touched surfaces are cleaned more regularly than normal. Staff clean and disinfect these throughout the day.<br><br>
                        <b>Will my child’s routine change?</b><br>We have worked hard to keep a normal routine as is possible. Sleep and mealtimes are not affected. Due to the nature of working in smaller groups, play routines have been altered to reduce contact with other groups of children. Since returning to nursery, all children have adapted well to the “new normal”. Children will continue to have access to the garden and time outside will be prioritised.<br><br>
                        <b>Will parents and visitors be allowed into the nursery?</b><br>Unfortunately, at this time we are not permitting parents or visitors to enter the nursery. The only visitors that will enter the nursery during the nursery day will be for emergencies only or external agencies who are required to support a child (where virtual support is not appropriate). Ofsted have withheld any inspections until the January 2021. All nursery tours will be completed virtually. Parents are allowed in the building for the first settling in session only, a full risk assessment has been carried out to allow this.<br>
                        <b>I am worried about dropping my child off at nursery and my child being upset, what can you do to reassure me?</b><br>Please be reassured that our priority will always be the children. All staff have received training on understanding children’s emotions while we have been away. The telephone is manned all day long, so please call if you want updates on your child.<br><br>
                        <b>What happens if staff are self isolating?</b><br>We will review staff numbers on a daily basis and consider ratios. We will only run if there is a member of staff in the building with a level 3 childcare qualification. We will endeavour to ensure that at least half of our staff hold a level 2 childcare qualification or above. There will always be a Paediatric First Aider on site and a DSL will always be contactable.<br><br>
                        <b>I cannot walk to nursery, am I okay to use public transport?</b><br>Please follow Government guidance regarding using Public Transport.<br><br>
                        <b>How will you source food for my child?</b><br>We will continue to ensure we provide a healthy and nutritious menu for the children. The menu however, may change on a daily basis due to food supplies. Online contactless delivery will be used when possible, if not then alternative means will be used.<br><br>
                        <b>Where can I get further advice?</b><br> The latest advice is available on the Government website.<br><br>
